# Overview

Each user/author on GitBook is associated with an account. You can create an account using your email or a Social Account such as **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **Google** or **GitHub**.

Organizations are more suited for businesses and large projects that need multiple owners and administrators.

## Delete your account

You can delete your personal account at [www.gitbook.com/settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings).

This action **CANNOT** be undone. This will delete all your books, builds, and transactions permanently. Once you delete your account, there is no going back. Please be certain.

## Duplicate Account

It occurs that you registered with a Social Account \(Facebook, Twitter, GitHub or Google\), then registered again using the form.

In this case, you created two distinct accounts \(one associated with your email, and another with your Social Account\).

You need to **remove** one of these account, to do so:

1. Logout from the account associated with your email
2. Login back using the social account
3. Delete this account at [www.gitbook.com/settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings)
4. Login back using your email
5. Associate the Social Account to your email account at [www.gitbook.com/settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings)
