# Organizations

Organizations are great for businesses and large projects that need multiple owners and administrators.

## What's the difference between user and organization accounts?

Your user account is your identity on GitBook. Your user account can be a member of any number of organizations, regardless of whether the account is on a free or paid plan.

### Personal user accounts

Every person who uses GitBook has their own user account. These accounts include:

* Unlimited public books and collaborators on all plans
* Personal plans for private books and distribution

  Ability to add unlimited repository collaborators

### Organizations

Organizations are great for businesses and large projects that need multiple owners and admins. They include:

* Business plans for private books and distribution
* Collaborators-based access permissions
* Unlimited administrators and collaborators using teams
* Billing receipts that can be sent to a second email address

## Create a new organization

When you [create a new organization](https://www.gitbook.com/organizations/new) from scratch, it doesn't have any books associated with it. At any time, members of the organization with write permissions can add new books, or transfer existing books.

## Converting a user into an organization

If you need to give more granular permissions for accessing books in a personal account, you can convert the personal account to an organization.

**Warning**: Before converting a user into an organization, keep these points in mind:

* You will no longer be able to sign into the converted user account.
* An organization cannot be converted back to a user.

### 1. Create a personal account

You cannot access books that belong to an organization unless you are one of its members. As a result, you'll need to create a second user account that will let you access the organization after you convert.

### 2. Leave any organizations you're already a member of

If the user you're converting is already a member of other organizations, you must first leave the other organizations.

### 3. Convert the account into an organization

* Open your [account settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings).
* Under "Transform account", enter the username of your new personnal account \(see section 1.\), click `Turn into an organization`.

### 4. Sign in to the organization

If you added your secondary personal account as the new owner in the last step of the conversion process, sign in to that account, and in the account context switcher, you'll be able to access your new organization!

## Transferring organization ownership

To make someone else the owner of an organization account, you must add a new owner, ensure that the billing information is updated, and then remove yourself from the account.

> Removing yourself from the organization does not update the billing information on file for the organization account. The new owner must update the billing information on file to remove your credit card information.

1. If you're the only member of the Owners team, add another organization member to the team.
2. Contact the new owner and make sure he or she is able to access the organization's settings.
3. If you are currently responsible for paying for GitBook in your organization, you'll also need to change the organization's billing information to reflect the new owner.
4. Remove yourself from the organization.
