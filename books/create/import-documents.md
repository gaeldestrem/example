# Importing from documents

Importing an existing document to GitBook is easy. Upload it when creating a book using the `Import` tab.

## Accepted formats

Here are the formats available for importation:

| Type | Extension |
| :--- | :--- |
| Microsoft Word Document | `.docx` |
| DocBook v5.x | `.xml` |
| HTML file | `.html` |

For better results, we recommend using:

* Microsoft Word 2007+ documents
* DocBook v5.x documents

For DocBook v4 documents, consider [converting them automatically to version 5](http://doccookbook.sourceforge.net/html/en/dbc.structure.db4-to-db5.html) for improved compatibility.

## Conversion

The import feature uses the [gitbook-convert](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-convert) CLI utility. This module converts the original document to markdown files, and generates a suitable `SUMMARY.md`.

[gitbook-convert](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-convert) infer a book structure from your document's structure, based on header levels. Top-level headers become chapters. Chapters are folders with a `README.md` as preface, and sub-chapters for every second-level headers. If no second-level headers are present, the chapter will consist of a single file instead of a folder.

Here is an example from a source document:

```text
This will be the book's preface (or README.md).
* Section 1
    This will be the preface of chapter 1.
    * Subsection 1.1
        ...
        * Subsubsection 1.1.1
            ...
        * Subsubsection 1.1.2
            ...
    * Subsection 1.2

* Section 2
    This will just be the content of chapter 2.
```

... to an output book structure:

```text
.
├── README.md
├── SUMMARY.md
├── chapter-1
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── subchapter-1-1.md
│   └── subchapter-1-2.md
└── chapter-2.md
```

For `.docx` documents, [gitbook-convert](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-convert) will also export all included images into an `assets/` folder.

If you ever need more flexibility, consider using [gitbook-convert](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-convert) locally, create a repository and import it using Git or GitHub.
