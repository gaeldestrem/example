# Creation & Importing

When creating books, your are prompted with several alternatives:

* Create from a template like _Basic_, or _Science_ \(already configured to use `mathjax`\)
* Import a book from GitHub \(see [hosting on GitHub](../github/#importing-from-an-existing-github-repository)\), or other git repositories
* Import from a document \([detailed process here](import-documents.md)\)

## Import from Git

If you have a project hosted on another version control system \(GIT\), you can automatically import it to GitBook when creating a book.

For password protected Git repository, you can use an HTTPS url with inlined authentication, ex:

```text
https://username:password@bitbucket.org/you/yourproject.git
```
